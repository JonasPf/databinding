# Overview

This is a prototype for a wxPython databinding framework. The idea is to directly bind object properties to widgets. When the property name is the same as the widget variable name, the binding can also be initialized automaticaly. This works great together with wxFormBuilder.

See binding_text.py for an example.

Tested on Python 2.7, wxPython 2.9 and Windows 7.
